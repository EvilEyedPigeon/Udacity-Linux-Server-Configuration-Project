# Udacity - Linux Server Configuration Project

An Udacity Full Stack Web Developer II Nanodegree Project.

## About

This tutorial will guide you through the steps to take a baseline installation of a Linux server and prepare it to host your Web applications. You will then secure your server from a number of attack vectors, install and configure a database server, and deploy one of your existing Flask-based Web applications onto it.

In this project, I have set up an Ubuntu 18.04 image on a DigitalOcean droplet. The technical details of the server as well as the steps that I have taken to set it up can be found in the succeeding sections.
